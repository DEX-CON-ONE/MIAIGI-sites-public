# miaigi — Practical AI for independent businesses

Helping small, independent teams automate the boring work, improve quality, and win back hours — safely, on the tools you already use.

This is the public site for miaigi ("my AI guy"). It doubles as a live example of how I use AI, GitHub Copilot, and GitHub to deliver useful results quickly and transparently.

## What I do

- AI discovery and quick‑win pilots
- Process automation (Power Automate, scripts, lightweight integrations)
- Practical GenAI (drafts, summaries, internal Q&A over your docs)
- AI readiness and governance (guardrails, access, logging, handover docs)

## Built with AI, on purpose

I co‑created this site with GitHub Copilot to prove the point:

- From prompt to page: Copilot drafted the initial copy and HTML/CSS skeleton; I iterated the tone to match how I speak with clients.
- Fast refactors: structure, headings, and accessibility tweaks landed in minutes, not days.
- No heavy stack: pure HTML/CSS + a few lines of JavaScript — deployable straight to GitHub Pages.
- Transparent version history: every change is tracked in Git, so improvements are easy to review and reuse.

The takeaway for clients: pairing an expert with AI tools collapses the time from idea → working result, without sacrificing clarity or control.

## How I work with GitHub + GitHub Copilot

- Draft and refine: use Copilot to generate first drafts (copy, markup, flows), then tighten with human judgement.
- Guardrails: keep changes small and reviewable; prefer simple, auditable solutions.
- Reuse playbooks: turn good prompts and patterns into repeatable checklists for your team.
- Ship often: frequent, low‑risk updates so value shows up early and keeps compounding.

## Why this matters for your business

- Speed: get working demos and measurable wins in weeks, not quarters.
- Quality: human‑in‑the‑loop reviews and clear boundaries for data, access, and outputs.
- Cost control: narrow scope, prove value, then scale what works.

## For developers (notes)

This site is a single‑page static site intended for GitHub Pages.

- Files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `site.js`, `logo.svg`, `favicon.svg`
- No build tools; keep assets small and accessible (contrast ≥ 4.5:1, visible focus, semantic headings)
- Deploy: push to `main`, then enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch → `main / root`)
